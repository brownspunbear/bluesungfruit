			<h2><a name="two">Burgeoning Artist</a></h2>

			<p>
			The materials involved in oil and acrylic painting used to give me tremendous headaches.
			Living in Beijing for some years (studying tattooing, but that's another story),
			the convenience of a small digital drawing tablet became very tempting (one brush, one canvas, no paints, no cleaning!),
			and with the subsequent lack of headaches I haven’t much looked back.
			Most of my work is now hand-drawn in a computer, in a similar way that one paints with oils,
			and I usually to aim to give my work a traditionally painted feel,
			exploring the major academic components of traditional painting (form, light, composition, brushwork, etc)
			while also adventuring into an array of new techniques that are offered digitally.
			I also work with charcoal, pencil, and other traditional media when they fit the bill for a particular piece.
			</p>

			<h2><a name="two">Digital Painting</a></h2>

			<p>
			My <a href="https://www.wacom.com/en-in/products/pen-tablets">electronic tablet</a>
			is like a pressure-sensitive mouse.
			It plugs into a computer and pairs with a stylus (pen) that it can detect by
			<a href="https://www.tablet4u.co.uk/techinfo">electromagnetic resonance</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
			The pen acts as a brush, or pencil, or piece of chalk,
			and the tablet acts as the canvas, or paper, or board.
			Using the relevant computer program, one can draw exactly as with a real pen,
			choose different brush types, apply colours, mix, erase,
			and build images in the same way one builds up paint on a canvas.
			</p>

		</div>
		<div>

			<h2><a name="three">Do You Use Photos?</a></h2>
			<p>
			There are numerous software applications available to use
			with tablets, including Photoshop, Corel Painter, ArtRage, and Krita, and they
			each offer varied options and limitations. I have heard that a touchscreen
			tablet such as an iPad, with the relevant software, can also make an excellent
			painting companion. My general preferences are Photoshop and ArtRage Lite on my
			large PC monitor.
			</p>

			<p>
			This is one point where many people get confused. “You use Photoshop?
			But I thought you said ‘painting’? Isn’t that just manipulating photos?”
			</p>

			<p>
			<span class="bigword">In a word, “No.” I do not use photos <i>in</i> my art.</span>
			</p>

			<p>
			It is certainly possible to, and many digital artists do – the huge
			industry of concept and production art for movies and videogames often relies
			heavily on a mixture of digital painting and photomanipulation – but, as far as
			is possible, I treat my digital paintings the same way I would
			treat a traditional drawing or painting.
			</p>

			<p>
			I do, however, frequently refer to photographs when painting
			and drawing, as many artists do in lieu of live models or being able to sit
			outside and paint (it's harder to take a big computer to the top of
			a mountain and set it up than a canvas and some brushes and paints).
			</p>

			<p>
			Painters have been using photographs for reference since
			<a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/in-focus/pegwell-bay-kent-william-dyce/painting-and-photography">as early as the 1850s</a>,
			and both painting and photography have informed each other
			in the intervening time as much as they have been in
			<a href="https://www.mardecortesbaja.com/2007/02/16/victorian-academic-painting/">competition</a>
			with each other. Many of the great artists from the 20<sup>th</sup> Century,
			including illustrators such as Norman Rockwell and Walter Everett,
			influential comicbook artists, and realist painters,
			have used photographs of themselves and others,
			and of animals and landscapes and all sorts of other things,
			as tailorable, static, convenient reference sources.
			</p>

			<h2><a name="four">My Process</a></h2>

			<p>
			There are many possible ways of using a tablet, but I proceed in much the same way that I would with physical paint.
			Take a portrait painting, for example.
			One method is to start by filling in a general background colour,
			then drawing the face – sketch out the proportions, draw the important features, shade the darker areas –
			then paint over this template in full colour.
			Another method is to start with general blocks of colour,
			then gradually define and adapt these blocks,
			adding more complex colour relationships and details until the figure is revealed.
			</p>

			<p>
			I like to experiment, and use various methods,
			but every line and splash of colour in my paintings is put there by my hand,
			not by a camera or a computer algorithm.
			</p>

			<p>
			<span class="bigword">My paintings are, in this sense, 100% hand-painted.</span>
			</p>

			<p>
			When I first purchased my tablet, in order to learn the
			technological side of digital painting I spent a lot of time online, reading
			tutorials and studying the work of digital artists involved in the movie and
			video game industries and modern illustrators and designers who use tablets.
			The concept art behind the scenes of many modern movies, as
			well as pretty much all video games, is frequently mind-blowing and takes great
			skill and vision to produce, and it has informed my art immensely.
			The work of Craig Mullins and Jaime Jones, in particular,
			helped me realise just what could be done digitally.
			</p>

			<p>
			At the same time, though, I’ve tried to learn the essentials
			of great art &mdash; of line, form, light, colour, composition, brushwork, etc &mdash; from
			traditional artists. I am a great admirer of the works of Anders Zorn, Joaqín Sorolla,
			Ivan Aivazovsky, John Singer Sargent, Salvador Dalí, and Walter
			Everett, as well as contemporary artists such as Richard Schmid and Ruo Li.

			<h2><a name="six">The Important Bit</a></h2>

			<p>
			Time for some (mostly coherent) rambling.
			</p>

			<p>
			The main sentiment I’d like to get across is this:
			</p>

			<p>
			<span class="bigword">It takes as much knowledge of the fundamental principles of visual art to create a
			digital painting as it does a traditional one.</span>
			</p>

			<p>
			My brand of digital art requires some different expertise from painting with wet paint,
			and involves various differences in execution,
			but should not be considered fundamentally different as an application of knowledge,
			a creative process, or as a final product.
			</p>

			<p>
			The most important elements of visual art include composition, draughtsmanship,
			light &amp; colour, emotion, subject matter, and storytelling,
			and equal importance should be placed on such considerations regardless of medium.
			</p>

			<p>
			Think about music, for a moment. Maybe you like Bach, Coltrane, Bowie, or the Wu-Tang Clan.
			It's likely that some of your favourites use traditional instruments, some electronic, and some a mixture.
			Today, electronic devices designed to mimic or replay traditional instruments are everywhere,
			from electric guitars and keyboards to samplers and drum machines;
			and there is plenty of music that relies exclusively on synthesisers.
			What's more, everything you listen to through speakers or in headphones has been recorded,
			mastered, and likely distributed electronically.
			</p>

			<p>
			So... how much importance do you place on the tools used to create your favourite music?
			And how much on beauty, creativeness, skill, or simply the way the music makes you feel?
			</p>

			<p>
			<span class="bigword">In other words: if it pleases you, if it moves you,
			what difference if it was painted in a cave 10,000 years ago, on a canvas in 1656,
			or using a computer in 2019?</span>
			</p>
